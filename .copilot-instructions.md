# Copilot Instructions

## Commit Message Generation

When `src/company_ai_list.py` or `src/company_list.py` are updated, generate commit messages that include the company names being added or modified.

### Format

**For single company list updates:**
```
chore: update {file_description}: {company_names} [automated]
```

**For multiple company list updates:**
```
chore: update {file_description_1} & {file_description_2}: {company_names} [automated]
```

### Examples

- `chore: update AI companies (3): anthropic, openai, groq [automated]`
- `chore: update Crypto companies (5): kraken, phantom, blockstream, binance, ethereum-foundation [automated]`
- `chore: update AI companies (2) & Crypto companies (4): openai, cohere, kraken, phantom, polkadot, solana [automated]`

### Guidelines

1. **Extract company names** from the first parameter of `CompanyItem()` calls
2. **Show up to 5 companies** by name, then add `(+N more)` if there are additional companies
3. **Count companies** and include in parentheses: `AI companies (12)`, `Crypto companies (8)`
4. **Preserve the `[automated]` tag** at the end for automated workflow commits
5. **Use sentence case** for file descriptions: "AI companies", "Crypto companies"

### File Identification

- `src/company_ai_list.py` → "AI companies"
- `src/company_list.py` → "Crypto companies"

### Context

These instructions apply to automated workflow commits via GitHub Actions and manual updates to company lists. The goal is to provide meaningful commit context by including the actual company names being modified.
