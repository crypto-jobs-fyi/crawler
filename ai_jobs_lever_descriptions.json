In what ways is America exceptional within the Western world? At Palantir, Fellows begin their journey by exploring these fundamental questions through curated readings and seminars with leading experts. This initial period is designed to immerse Fellows in rigorous debate and open exchange of ideas\u2014laying the intellectual foundation before they join forward-deployed engineering or internal software teams.\n\nIn our inaugural cohort, Fellows engaged with world-class historians, philosophers, scientists, writers, and technologists, including Gideon Rose, Edward Wittenstein, Bob McGrew, Reihan Salaam, Hal Brands, Shilo Brooks, Larry Arn, Mark Lilla, Lawrence Wright, Adam Klein, Brendan McCord, Lt. General (ret.) George Smith, Bob Langer, Itai Yanai, among others. They also learned from Palantirians such as Dr. Alex Karp, Shyam Sankar, Ted Mabrey, Akshay Krishnaswamy, Courtney Bowman, Nicholas Zamiska, Samantha Clark, Parvathy Menon, and more.\n\nOur most vital technologies cannot be created by those indifferent to their purpose. Today\u2019s challenges demand builders who are guided by conviction and a clear sense of mission.\n\nThe Role\n\nFollowing the first part of the Fellowship, you\u2019ll work alongside Forward Deployed Engineers and software developers to build software and deliver customer outcomes.

You thrive on taking complex concepts and distilling them into straightforward, crisp stories.\n\nA note about the distinction between Communications, Product, and Concept Design roles at Palantir:\n\u2022  Communications Designers are responsible for upholding Palantir's brand standards. They are the visual storytellers for branding, marketing, presentations, and events.\n\u2022  Product Designers define, design, and assist in building new user interfaces across our core platforms: Gotham, Foundry, Apollo, and AIP. They collaborate with Forward Deployed Engineers to gain context about end users and their unique workflows.\n\u2022  Concept Designers are on the bleeding edge of new product. They imagine what new offerings could look like, whether additions to the core platforms, or something tailored to a potential customer.",

By bringing the right data to the people who need it, our platforms empower our partners to develop lifesaving drugs, forecast supply chain disruptions, locate missing children, and more.\n\nThe Role\n\nPalantir Foundry is an end-to-end platform for data-driven decision-making, and as a 3D Software Engineer, you will play a pivotal role in extending its capabilities to handle advanced 3D visualization and geospatial workflows. We're transforming the way organizations integrate and interact with complex 3D data\u2014such as gaussian splats, point clouds, BIM files, CAD models, and schematics\u2014so they can build reliable, mission-critical applications atop a unified foundation.\n\nIn this role, you will join a specialized team within Foundry focused on 3D tools and visualization, working closely with industries like Architecture, Construction, Automotive, Aerospace, Space, Oil and Gas, Mining, and Utilities.

You will develop new end-to-end approaches for displaying 3D geometry\u2014from offline pre-processing of large datasets to novel realtime approaches on the GPU\u2014and build applications that use them for visualization and analysis. Your work will empower customers to build sophisticated applications, such as interactive dashboards for construction sites, geospatial analysis tools for mining operations, or simulation environments for aerospace design.\n\nYou may spend one day collaborating with customers in the construction sector to understand their needs when visualizing BIM files, identify gaps in their current tools, and prototype solutions. The next day, you might brainstorm with teammates on optimizing shader performance for rendering large-scale point clouds or voxel models in real time, or work with backend engineers to define APIs and schemas that back these workflows.\n\nYou\u2019ll regularly face sophisticated technical problems, requiring you to scope out the solution design and find an incremental path to ship new features. As part of this, you will own APIs and schemas that power your frontend code, or work with other backend engineers in developing them together.\n\nBelow are some examples of the types of product work you\u2019d get to do in this role:\n\u2022  3D Visualization Tools: Build interactive tools for rendering and manipulating 3D models, such as CAD and BIM files, enabling architects and engineers to explore designs in real time.\n\u2022  Geospatial Workflows: Develop features for visualizing and analyzing geospatial data like gaussian splats, point clouds, and voxel models, supporting use cases in utilities, mining, oil and gas exploration, and urban planning.\n\u2022  Shader Development: Write and optimize custom shaders to enhance the performance and visual fidelity of renderings for applications in aerospace and automotive design.\n\u2022  Digital Twins: Create interfaces for integrating 3D schematics and real-time sensor data, powering digital twin applications for utilities and industrial facilities.\n\u2022  Performance Optimization: Solve complex challenges related to rendering large-scale 3D datasets, ensuring smooth performance for end-users in high-stakes environments like space mission planning.  \n\nFrontline\n\nFoundry Software Engineers may be offered the opportunity to Frontline, an exclusive program unlike any other. This unique, short-term assignment involves being embedded with customers, allowing you to work directly with users and gain firsthand insight into how our products are used and the challenges our customers face. Unlike traditional engineering roles, Frontline immerses you in complex, ambiguous problems, empowering you to deliver impactful solutions across some of the world\u2019s most important industries and institutions.\n\nSome of our most successful products were built on the factory floor, addressing real-world problems for the world's most important institutions.

By bringing the right data to the people who need it, our platforms empower our partners to develop lifesaving drugs, forecast supply chain disruptions, locate missing children, and more.\n\nThe Role\n\nBackend Software Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organisations use data. Our Software Engineers are involved throughout the product lifecycle, from idea generation, design, prototyping, and production delivery. You will collaborate closely with technical and non-technical teammates to understand our customers' problems and build products that solve them. We encourage movement across teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different technologies and aspects of each product. Engineers work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop, becoming a strong technical contributor and engineering leader.\n\nYour day-to-day workflow will vary, adapting to the requirements of our users and the technical challenges that arise. One day, you may find yourself collaborating with other engineers to architect a new system that enables a novel workflow, the next you could be fine-tuning performance to enable low-latency operational outcomes.\n\nOur Product Development organisation is made up of small teams of Software Engineers. Each team focuses on a specific aspect of a product and work collaboratively to build cross functional capabilities, streamline user workflows and continuously improve our software's efficiency and reliability.\n\nWe\u2019re hiring engineers who are passionate about solving real-world problems and empowering both developers and end-users to work optimally. If you\u2019re motivated to develop reliable, performant, and scalable systems, and to design robust APIs and primitives, this role offers the opportunity to make a significant impact on our products and the people who use them.\n\nFrontline\n\nFoundry Software Engineers may be offered the opportunity to Frontline, an exclusive program unlike any other. This unique, short-term assignment involves being embedded with customers, allowing you to work directly with users and gain firsthand insight into how our products are used and the challenges our customers face. Unlike traditional engineering roles, Frontline immerses you in complex, ambiguous problems, empowering you to deliver impactful solutions across some of the world\u2019s most important industries and institutions.\n\nSome of our most successful products were built on the factory floor, addressing real-world problems for the world's most important institutions. These products were developed by some of our most successful product engineers, who began their careers in roles aligned with Frontline responsibilities, gaining a deep understanding of both our technology and our customers.\n\nFrontliners operate across a broad spectrum of responsibilities, much like a startup CTO. They work in small teams to own the end-to-end execution of high-stakes projects. This spectrum ranges from discussing architecture and building custom web apps to conducting workshops with users and strategizing with customer executives.

By bringing the right data to the people who need it, our platforms empower our partners to develop lifesaving drugs, forecast supply chain disruptions, locate missing children, and more.\n\nThe Role\n\nAre you passionate about engineering quality, performance, and increasing the impact of engineers around you?\n\nSoftware Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organisations around the world use data. As an engineer within Palantir\u2019s Foundations organisation, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to grow more quickly than you ever imagined, as you build the shared infrastructure that underpins the Palantir Foundry, Palantir Gotham, and Palantir Apollo platforms, and drive investments to improve the velocity and quality of our engineering.\n\nTeams within Palantir\u2019s Foundations organisation are made up of a small number of engineers, each focused on one of four major categories of our infrastructure:\n\n\u2022 Backend Infrastructure: Maximises the productivity of our backend developers and ensures Palantir\u2019s platforms have performant and consistent RESTful services. Think: making the \u201ceasy way\u201d the \u201cright way\u201d when developing backend services, including designing infrastructure to build hundreds of micro-service repos performantly, or to ensure we keep reliable audit logs of everything users do in our platforms.\n\u2022 Developer Infrastructure: Operates the systems and services that underpin all aspects of our developer ecosystem, including off-the-shelf tooling like GitHub and custom tooling for managing automated changes across hundreds of repositories.\n\u2022 Frontend Infrastructure: Maximises frontend developer productivity across the entire frontend development stack, from the developer experience in the IDE to the final user experience in the browser. Think: the core infrastructure required to develop and serve our frontends (including feature flags, internationalisation, and commit previews), performant build tooling for millions of lines of TypeScript, and the Blueprint open source UI framework.\n\u2022 Storage Infrastructure: Develops Palantir\u2019s database and search systems, which includes supporting storage technologies across cloud, on-premises, and classified or secure environments. This includes evolving our existing technologies to support ever-increasing data scale and latency requirements, and designing the next evolution of our database offering to provide step-change improvements in particular workflows.\n\nCore Responsibilities\n\nAs a Software Engineering Intern in Foundations, your projects may include building features to improve the developer experience for other Palantir engineers, or improving the scalability and reliability of Palantir\u2019s platforms.\n\nYou\u2019ll be involved throughout the product lifecycle, from idea generation and design, to execution and rollout, all while being paired with a mentor dedicated to your growth and success. You'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our developers' and customers' problems and build infrastructure to tackle them.\n\nTechnologies We Use\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what languages you know when you join us; what matters is that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers that bring diverse experience\u2014whether you\u2019re a former university Teaching Assistant, switched to computer science recently, or are a hackathon enthusiast\u2014you'll build your skills to apply the best technology to solve a given problem.

As an engineer within Palantir\u2019s Foundations organization, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to grow more quickly than you ever imagined, as you build the shared infrastructure that underpins the Palantir Foundry, Palantir Gotham, and Palantir Apollo platforms, and drive investments to improve the velocity and quality of our engineering.\n\nTeams within Palantir\u2019s Foundations organization are made up of a small number of engineers, each focused on one of four major categories of our infrastructure:\n\n\u2022 Backend Infrastructure: Maximizes the productivity of our backend developers and ensures Palantir\u2019s platforms have performant and consistent RESTful services. Think: making the \u201ceasy way\u201d the \u201cright way\u201d when developing backend services, including designing infrastructure to build hundreds of micro-service repos performantly, or to ensure we keep reliable audit logs of everything users do in our platforms.\n\u2022 Developer Infrastructure: Operates the systems and services that underpin all aspects of our developer ecosystem, including off-the-shelf tooling like GitHub and custom tooling for managing automated changes across hundreds of repositories.\n\u2022 Frontend Infrastructure: Maximizes frontend developer productivity across the entire frontend development stack, from the developer experience in the IDE to the final user experience in the browser. Think: the core infrastructure required to develop and serve our frontends (including features flags, internationalization, and commit previews), performant build tooling for millions of lines of TypeScript, and the Blueprint open source UI framework.\n\u2022 Storage Infrastructure: Develops Palantir\u2019s database and search systems, which includes supporting storage technologies across cloud, on-premise, and classified or secure environments.

For more information, visit www.shield.ai. Follow Shield AI on LinkedIn, X, Instagram, and YouTube. \n\nJOB DESCRIPTION:\n\nThe Special Projects team at Shield AI is an elite force within the office of the CTO. It consists of a group of very senior (L5-L8) and highly experienced software engineering experts from diverse fields (aerospace, robotics, cloud infrastructure, game development, interactive media design, ...). The charter of this group is to steer technology development towards strategic alignment with the CTO\u2019s vision, through tactical insertion into teams and technologies across the organization. Individuals within this team make direct and at times forward-sprinting contributions to all three pillars of Hivemind, Shield AI\u2019s software ecosystem for developing and deploying resilient intelligent teaming for aircrafts. Hivemind consists of four products: EdgeOS (C++ based high-performance middleware for autonomy development), Pilot (autonomy for the edge built atop EdgeOS; a models-based, modular and open architecture C++ codebase), Forge (Shield AI's AI Factory for the design, development, and testing of Hivemind Edge systems; a service-oriented architecture leveraged through an SDK, CLI, and web portal; a Go, Python, Typescript codebase), Commander (Software and hardware to support rich human-in-the-loop and human-on-the-loop interactions with the Hivemind; a C++-based back-end for interaction with Pilot; and a web-application UI for mission planning, command and control by operators implemented in a Typescript/React codebase).\n\nThe Special Projects team is chartered to operate effectively within ambiguity. While this team does not own any software products, it tactically and strategically impacts the development of all foundational Hivemind products and leverages those technologies to rapidly deliver low-TRL solutions. This work happens should-to-shoulder with the product teams in some cases, and in a forward-sprinting manner within the Special Projects team in other cases. The result is direct contribution to products in the formercase, and development of reference implementations in the latter. The Special Projects team also functions as a pipeline for product and solution engineering teams across the organization. Individuals who enter the Special Projects team rapidly gain depth and breadth in their understanding of the Hivemind software ecosystem. This positions them well for leading technology development effort across the product and solution organization. ",

The biggest challenge AI companies face today is not nearly as glamorous as the outside world may think: it's all about data quality. In fact, the success of any AI application today relies on the quality of a model's training data. For 95% of teams, this essential step is both the most costly, and the most time-consuming in getting their product to market.\n\nAs ex-computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we felt first-hand how the lack of tools to prepare quality training data was impeding the progress of building AI. AI today is what the early days of computing or the internet were like, where the potential of the technology is clear, but the tools and processes surrounding it are still primitive, preventing the next generation of applications. This is why we started Encord.\n\nWe are a team of 100+, working at the cutting edge of multimodal and visual AI. Encord is backed by top investors, including CRV, Y Combinator, and Next47, leading industry executives like Luc Vincent, former VP of AI at Meta, and other Bay Area AI leaders.

You will be working on a mix of strategic work (ideating and executing on success plans, running growth campaigns like referral programs, customer events or holiday merch drops) and operational work (identifying & prospecting new champions across our customer base, running onboardings and demos, guiding tech teams through best practices).\n\nYou'll be joining Encord at an inflection point \u2014 over the last 18 months, we've built a world-class team, raised our $30M Series B (from Next47, YC, Crane) and onboarded hundreds of the leading AI companies onto Encord. We work with many of the teams we all read about in the news - and take this ownership as both a big responsibility and an exciting opportunity to help develop leading AI products.\n\nIf you're ready to take ownership, solve complex problems, and help define the future of AI infrastructure, this role is for you!\n\n About you\n- You have 1-4 years of experience in a client-facing role in a high-intensity, fast-paced environment.\n- You're as comfortable handling in-the-weeds implementations as you are communicating to executives about a project plan. You are a great communicator and enjoy running demos, prospecting and building relationships with customers.\n- You derive energy from owning & successfully completing projects, and are great at balancing detail-focus with bigger-picture thinking.\n- You are highly organized and great at managing your time across many competing priorities.\n- You're ambitious and care lots about your career. You're probably happiest when working really hard and solving challenging problems. You know this requires dedication & some sacrifice but you think it's worth it.

    "description": "About Encord\n\nAt Encord, we're building the AI infrastructure of the future. One of the biggest challenges AI companies face today is data quality. The success of any AI application relies heavily on the quality of its training data, yet for most teams, this crucial step is both the most costly and time-consuming. We\u2019re here to change that.\nAs former computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we\u2019ve experienced firsthand how a lack of tools to prepare quality training data impedes progress in building AI. We believe AI is at a stage similar to the early days of computing or the internet\u2014where the potential is clear, but the surrounding tools and processes are still catching up. That's why we started Encord.\n\nWe are a talented and ambitious team of 100+, working at the cutting edge of computer vision and deep learning. Backed by $30M in Series B funding from top investors like CRV and Y Combinator, we\u2019re one of the fastest-growing companies in our space. We have big plans ahead and are looking to expand our Engineering team to help us in building a better product for our customers.\n\nWho we are looking for\n\nWe're looking for an outstanding engineer to push our platform to the next level. You'll join us at a crucial stage of accelerated development for the company, product and team. As part of a small, highly collaborative group, you'll drive our product and team to new heights.\nEncord is growing rapidly, with our product as the key driver of that growth. A year ago, we were a team of 50; now, we\u2019re over 100 and continuing to accelerate.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nHigh performing team: You'll join the small team that has built a product that our customers love and consistently rate as the best in the market. Members of the team are veterans of both Big Tech and successful startups. While the team is more than a sum of its parts, every member on the team is impressive on their own.\nImpact: Your work will have direct and tangible impact for customers and in turn noticeably affect the trajectory of the company.\nEnd-to-end ownership: You will be entrusted with end-to-end ownership of your projects. From product, design and architectural decisions, all the way to deployment, monitoring and measuring impact on users. You will work across the stack, covering everything from deployment to styling. We expect each other to take initiative, be proactive in problem-solving, and continuously seek improvements.\nAutonomy and collaboration: You will often work autonomously to take charge of your projects, make decisions, and drive your work forward. On the other hand, as a lean and high trust team, we remain quick to collaborate and support each other with challenging problems together, and you will have amazing team mates to get guidance and learn from.\nScale and simplicity: You will tackle complex domains and immense scale with simple solutions. You'll leverage your expertise to solve challenging problems in simple ways.\n\nAbout You\n\nAre experienced: You have personally developed and maintained multiple systems from scratch or significantly contributed to major changes to existing systems. You know what trade offs are involved in building reliable, performant software at speed.\nSeek high impact: You want your work to have a tangible outcome for people. You're not satisfied when building products that do not see the light of day or move a number by a tenth of a percent.\nAre a builder: You enjoy all aspects of building not only software but a complete product and are comfortable moving across the stack when necessary. You enjoy problem solving and thinking from first principles. You\u2019re ready to pick up new skills and build quickly.\nAre comfortable with uncertainty: You're happy to tackle problems without a predefined clear definition or obvious solution, and are excited to have autonomy to make decisions as you go.\nAre a team player: You understand that being a member of a high-performing team requires two things. You contribute your best work. You also help others contribute their best.

From product, design and architectural decisions, all the way to deployment, monitoring and measuring impact on users. You will work across the stack, covering everything from deployment to styling. We expect each other to take initiative, be proactive in problem-solving, and continuously seek improvements.\nAutonomy and collaboration: You will often work autonomously to take charge of your projects, make decisions, and drive your work forward. On the other hand, as a lean and high trust team, we remain quick to collaborate and support each other with challenging problems together, and you will have amazing team mates to get guidance and learn from.\nScale and simplicity: You will tackle complex domains and immense scale with simple solutions. You'll leverage your expertise to solve challenging problems in simple ways.\n\nAbout You\n\nAre experienced: You have personally developed and maintained multiple systems from scratch or significantly contributed to major changes to existing systems. You know what trade offs are involved in building reliable, performant software at speed.\nSeek high impact: You want your work to have a tangible outcome for people.

    "description": "About Encord\n\nAt Encord, we're building the AI infrastructure of the future. One of the biggest challenges AI companies face today is data quality. The success of any AI application relies heavily on the quality of its training data, yet for most teams, this crucial step is both the most costly and time-consuming. We\u2019re here to change that.\nAs former computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we\u2019ve experienced firsthand how a lack of tools to prepare quality training data impedes progress in building AI. We believe AI is at a stage similar to the early days of computing or the internet\u2014where the potential is clear, but the surrounding tools and processes are still catching up. That's why we started Encord.\n\nWe are a talented and ambitious team of 100+, working at the cutting edge of computer vision and deep learning. Backed by $30M in Series B funding from top investors like CRV and Y Combinator, we\u2019re one of the fastest-growing companies in our space. We have big plans ahead and are looking to expand our Engineering team to help us in building a better product for our customers.\n\nWho we are looking for\n\nWe're looking for an outstanding engineer to push our platform to the next level. You'll join us at a crucial stage of accelerated development for the company, product and team. As part of a small, highly collaborative group, you'll drive our product and team to new heights.\n\nEncord is growing rapidly, with our product as the key driver of that growth. A year ago, we were a team of 25; now, we\u2019re 60 and continuing to accelerate.\n\n\n\nWhat to expect\n\n- High performing team: You'll join the small team that has built a product that our customers love and consistently rate as the best in the market. Members of the team are veterans of both Big Tech and successful startups. While the team is more than a sum of its parts, every member on the team is impressive on their own.\n- Impact: Your work will have direct and tangible impact for customers and in turn noticeably affect the trajectory of the company.\n- End-to-end ownership: You will be entrusted with end-to-end ownership of your projects. From product, design and architectural decisions, all the way to deployment, monitoring and measuring impact on users. You will work across the stack, covering everything from deployment to styling. We expect each other to take initiative, be proactive in problem-solving, and continuously seek improvements.\n- Autonomy and collaboration: You will often work autonomously to take charge of your projects, make decisions, and drive your work forward. But as a lean and high trust team, we remain quick to collaborate and support each other with challenging problems together.\n- Scale and simplicity: You will tackle complex domains and immense scale with simple solutions. You'll leverage your expertise to solve challenging problems in simple ways.\n\n\nAbout You\n\n- Are experienced: You have seen a lot and built a lot compared to your peers. You have personally developed and maintained multiple systems from scratch and you know what trade offs are involved in building reliable, performant software at speed. \n- Seek high impact: You want your work to have a tangible outcome for people. You're not satisfied when building products that do not see the light of day or move a number by a tenth of a percent.\n- Are a builder: You enjoy all aspects of building not only software but a complete product and are comfortable moving across the stack when necessary. You enjoy problem solving and thinking from first principles. You\u2019re ready to pick up new skills and build quickly.\n- Are comfortable with uncertainty: You're happy to tackle problems without a predefined clear definition or obvious solution, and are excited to have autonomy to make decisions as you go.\n- Are a team player: You understand that being a member of a high-performing team requires two things. You contribute your best work. You also help others contribute their best. You enjoy lending a helping hand when needed and levelling up those around you.\n\n\nTech stack\n\nWe are technology agnostic at Encord. We are not looking for you to have experience in all these technologies. As long as you're open to learning, please apply.\nWe currently use Python and Typescript across our codebase. Prior experience is appreciated but not required.\n\nBelow is a detailed breakdown of all the technologies we use.\n- Backend: Python\n- Frontend: Typescript and React\n- Kubernetes for deployment\n- GCP for underlying infrastructure\n- Machine Learning: PyTorch, CUDA, Ray\n\nWe encourage people from all backgrounds, cultures and skill levels to apply. It is okay to not meet all requirements listed as we are looking for individuals who are passionate, eager to learn.\n\n\nWhat We Offer\n- Competitive salary, commission and equity in a hyper growth business.\n- Strong in-person culture: most of our team is in the office 3+ days a week.\n- Room to grow into anything you choose to \u2014 a year ago we were 50 people, now we're 100+. We'll be growing insanely fast over the next 24 months and you'll have all the opportunities for growth as you can handle.\n- 25 days annual leave a year + public holidays.\n\nEncord offers a unique opportunity to be part of a startup with a clear mission and vision. You will get to explore and build services enterprise AI use cases across many different industry verticals such as healthcare, surveillance, retail, agriculture and many more. \n\nOur work is at the cutting edge of computer vision and deep learning, which also includes working on solving unsolved problems within those fields.",

    "description": "About Encord\n\nAt Encord, we're building the AI infrastructure of the future. One of the biggest challenges AI companies face today is data quality. The success of any AI application relies heavily on the quality of its training data, yet for most teams, this crucial step is both the most costly and time-consuming. We\u2019re here to change that.\nAs former computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we\u2019ve experienced firsthand how a lack of tools to prepare quality training data impedes progress in building AI. We believe AI is at a stage similar to the early days of computing or the internet\u2014where the potential is clear, but the surrounding tools and processes are still catching up. That's why we started Encord.\n\nWe are a talented and ambitious team of 100+, working at the cutting edge of computer vision and deep learning. Backed by $30M in Series B funding from top investors like CRV and Y Combinator, we\u2019re one of the fastest-growing companies in our space. We have big plans ahead and are looking to expand our Engineering team to help us in building a better product for our customers.\n\nWho we are looking for\n\nWe're looking for an outstanding engineer to push our platform to the next level. You'll join us at a crucial stage of accelerated development for the company, product and team. As part of a small, highly collaborative group, you'll drive our product and team to new heights.\n\nEncord is growing rapidly, with our product as the key driver of that growth. A year ago, we were a team of 25; now, we\u2019re 60 and continuing to accelerate.\n\n\n\nWhat to expect\n\n- High performing team: You'll join the small team that has built a product that our customers love and consistently rate as the best in the market. Members of the team are veterans of both Big Tech and successful startups. While the team is more than a sum of its parts, every member on the team is impressive on their own.\n- Impact: Your work will have direct and tangible impact for customers and in turn noticeably affect the trajectory of the company.\n- End-to-end ownership: You will be entrusted with end-to-end ownership of your projects. From product, design and architectural decisions, all the way to deployment, monitoring and measuring impact on users. You will work across the stack, covering everything from deployment to styling. We expect each other to take initiative, be proactive in problem-solving, and continuously seek improvements.\n- Autonomy and collaboration: You will often work autonomously to take charge of your projects, make decisions, and drive your work forward. But as a lean and high trust team, we remain quick to collaborate and support each other with challenging problems together.\n- Scale and simplicity: You will tackle complex domains and immense scale with simple solutions. You'll leverage your expertise to solve challenging problems in simple ways.\n\n\nAbout You\n\n- Are experienced: You have seen a lot and built a lot compared to your peers. You have personally developed and maintained multiple systems from scratch and you know what trade offs are involved in building reliable, performant software at speed. \n- Seek high impact: You want your work to have a tangible outcome for people. You're not satisfied when building products that do not see the light of day or move a number by a tenth of a percent.\n- Are a builder: You enjoy all aspects of building not only software but a complete product and are comfortable moving across the stack when necessary. You enjoy problem solving and thinking from first principles. You\u2019re ready to pick up new skills and build quickly.\n- Are comfortable with uncertainty: You're happy to tackle problems without a predefined clear definition or obvious solution, and are excited to have autonomy to make decisions as you go.\n- Are a team player: You understand that being a member of a high-performing team requires two things. You contribute your best work. You also help others contribute their best. You enjoy lending a helping hand when needed and levelling up those around you.\n\n\nTech stack\n\nWe are technology agnostic at Encord. We are not looking for you to have experience in all these technologies. As long as you're open to learning, please apply.\nWe currently use Python and Typescript across our codebase. Prior experience is appreciated but not required.\n\nBelow is a detailed breakdown of all the technologies we use.\n- Backend: Python\n- Frontend: Typescript and React\n- Kubernetes for deployment\n- GCP for underlying infrastructure\n- Machine Learning: PyTorch, CUDA, Ray\n\nWe encourage people from all backgrounds, cultures and skill levels to apply. It is okay to not meet all requirements listed as we are looking for individuals who are passionate, eager to learn.\n\n\n\nWhat We Offer\n\n- Competitive salary and equity in a hyper growth startup.\n- Real opportunities to grow. We\u2019re growing insanely fast and you\u2019ll have all the opportunities for growth that you can handle.\n- Strong in person culture. We're 3-5 days a week in our newly-launched loft office in North Beach.\n- Flexible PTO to recharge.\n- Annual learning and development budget.\n- 18 paid vacation days + federal holidays.\n- Lots of opportunities for travel (all around the US, to London & Europe).\n- Bi-annual off-sites and monthly socials.\n- Health, dental and vision insurance.\n\nEncord offers a unique opportunity to be part of a startup with a clear mission and vision. You will get to explore and build services enterprise AI use cases across many different industry verticals such as healthcare, surveillance, retail, agriculture, and many more. \n\nOur work is at the cutting edge of computer vision and deep learning, which also includes working on solving unsolved problems within those fields.",

In fact, the success of any AI application today relies on the quality of a model's data \u2014 and for 95% of teams, this essential step is both the most costly, and the most time-consuming, in getting their product to market.\n\nAs ex-computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we felt first-hand how the lack of tools to prepare quality training data was impeding the progress of building AI. AI today is what the early days of computing or the internet were like, where the potential of the technology is clear, but the tools and processes surrounding it are still primitive, preventing the next generation of applications. This is why we started Encord.\n\nWe are a talented and ambitious team of 100+, working at the cutting edge of multimodal AI and deep learning, backed by top investors, including Next47, CRV and YC, leading industry executives like Luc Vincent, former VP of AI at Meta, and other top Bay Area leaders in AI. We are one the fastest growing companies in our space, and consistently rated as the best tool in the market by our customers. We have big plans ahead and are looking for a rockstar Growth Associate to join us and help us scale.\n\n\nAbout The Role\n\nWe're looking for a Growth Associate - Community to own how technical teams discover and connect with Encord through community-led growth. You'll manage our social media presence, drive engagement at online and offline events, and build authentic relationships within ML and data communities. This high-visibility role reports directly to our VP of Growth and involves close collaboration with Encord leadership on community strategy. You'll represent Encord at major industry conferences and events, building relationships with technical practitioners and ecosystem partners. This role combines community management with strategic content distribution - creating conversations that convert awareness into active participation. You'll craft compelling narratives about data-centric AI and ensure community interactions flow seamlessly into product discovery. This is an excellent opportunity for a recent graduate with genuine interest in ML/data ops to own a high-impact growth function."

This team is responsible for collecting health data from a broad range of internal and external sources and making that data useful for users of the Zus platform. \n\nThe engineer joining this team will help build tools that interact with external health data networks to collect information about our patients and load it into the Zus data stores at high volume, as well as services used by customers and internal stakeholders to request that data.  The ideal candidate will be excited to take on the challenge of unifying diverse health care data sources to bring a clear picture of patient needs to our customers in ways that the developers of said data sources never thought or cared about.\n\nYou will work on data pipelines that operate on large scale data using a variety of AWS services (Step Functions, Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, etc).  You will also work on RESTful services that are used both internally and externally.  Go is our language of choice, although we also have some components written in NodeJS. The team is responsible for deploying, maintaining, and operating its pipelines and services.\n\nOur Zus engineering teams are all US-based, and we hire only in the US.  In Data Acquisition, we work across a collection of US timezones and also collaborate with our development partners in Central European Time.  Zus supports both remote work and hybrid work in the Boston area with an office near South Station, and our teams are a mix of both styles of work.  We actively work to make sure all voices are heard and information is shared regardless of your work location."
